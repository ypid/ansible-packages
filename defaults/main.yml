# .. envvar:: packages__reject_for_class
#
# Although a specific package would be included in the selection for a specific
# class, do not include it for this class. This does not ensure that the
# package is absent. Use ``packages__absent_for_class`` or
# ``packages__rejected_ensure_absent`` if that is what you want.
#
# Example::
#
#    packages__reject_for_class:
#      container:
#        - '{{ packages__single_needrestart }}'
#
# .. Don’t overdo it. This feature is currently disabled until it a real need occurs.
# ..
# .. For advanced users: You can also use a regular expression pattern for the class name which is illustrated in the following example::
# ..
# ..    packages__reject_for_class:
# ..      'container.*':
# ..        - '{{ packages__single_needrestart }}'
# ..
# .. This means that :jinja_code:`{{ packages__single_needrestart }}` will be rejected for ``container`` and ``container_app1`` (everything which the pattern matches).
