# Localization support [[[
# --------------------

# .. envvar:: packages__localizations
#
# List of language codes which should be supported.
# English (en-us) is the default and you should not need to specify it.
#
# For Debian, this feature works with a predefined list for packages which
# provide additional localization files in optional packages.
#
# For this to work, you need to provide certain identifiers for the language
# which should be supported:
#
# ``code``
#   Corresponds to a combined string of ISO 639-1 (or ISO 3166-3 if needed) plus ISO 3166-2 (if needed, separated by hyphen).
#   All lower case. Examples: ``en-gb``, ``de-at``
#   Check :file:`/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED` for a full list. Note that this file uses underscore instead of a hyphen.
#   You can also check :command:`apt-cache search firefox-esr-l10n` to get the idea.
#
# ``lang_culture``
#   Same as ``code`` except that ISO 3166-2 is not optional.
#   All lower case. Examples: ``en-gb``, ``de-de``
#
# ``name``
#   All lowercase name of the language. Example ``german``.
#
# Example::
#
#    packages__localizations:
#      - code: 'de'
#        culture: 'de-de'
#        name: 'german'

# Package origin presets for Debian GNU/Linux [[[
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Releases of Debian GNU/Linux usually don’t contain the latest upstream
# versions of software.  This is perfectly fine because the versions which are
# included in releases had some time to stabilize (no new features, only bug
# fixes) and it is less likely that bugs and security vulnerabilities are still
# existent in the released packages.
#
# However, when administrating a system based on Debian stable, users might
# still prefer or need newer versions of software then released with Debian
# Stable itself.
#
# To archive this, there are several options available, listed in order of
# preference starting with the most preferred one:
#
# #. `Debian Backports`_: Backports are packages taken from the next Debian
#    release (called testing), adjusted and recompiled for usage on Debian
#    stable.
#
# #. Debian testing or unstable. Depending on the packages, this might require
#    to upgrade some package dependencies to a newer version as well.
#
# #. Installing software from third-party repositories.
#
# #. Installing software from self build packages. Checkout the
#    debops.reprepro_ role which can get you started.
#
# #. Installing software from source.
#
# Only the first two options are converted by this section. But considering the
# size of the Debian package archive, these two options can get you pretty far.
#
# Note that you might need to enable releases in your ``sources.list(5)``.
# debops.apt_ can do that for you. Also note that when you do that, you will
# need to prevent APT to upgrade all of your packages to the latest version
# available. To do this, you can checkout the ``apt_preferences__preset_list``
# variable of the debops.apt_preferences_ role.
#
# The following lists only contain presets for packages not covered by more
# specific roles. For example the debops.apt_cacher_ng_ role might also set
# APT preferences. This will be configured by this role directly.

# .. envvar:: packages__debian_backports_list
#
# Preset of available `Debian Backports`_.
#
# Note that this also includes packages, which are only available in `Debian
# Backports`_, and where not released with the distribution.
#
# To use it, add the following:
#
# .. code-block:: yaml
#   :linenos:
#
#    apt_preferences__list:
#      - '{{ (packages__apt_preferences__debian_backports_list|d([]) | list) if (ansible_distribution == "Debian") else [] }}'
#
# to your inventory and let debops.apt_preferences_ do the rest.
# Note that debops.apt_preferences_ will need to run in the same context as this role.
